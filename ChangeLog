 - DTW examples added to the project, will implement it progressively
 - With multiple traces, DTW will proposed to be applied in a cyclic fashion and averaged.

 - Version of code at Proposal
 - Added code to create movieAvgDF, which is averaging values of different sessions of the same movie, with labels aligned
 - Saves movieAvgDF to a CSV file in Data/
 - NaN values from some columns during the averging process need to be verified
 - DTW needs to be implemented before the averaging

- Initial commit with simple analysis code base
- This requires the user to download the data files separately from https://www.kaggle.com/jswicker/the-smell-of-fear and create a folder named "Data/" that holds the extracted content
