abstract="Electronic noses (e-noses) employ an array of chemical gas sensors and have been widely used for the analysis of volatile organic compounds. Pattern recognition provides a higher degree of selectivity and reversibility to the systems leading to an extensive range of applications. These range from the food and medical industry to environmental monitoring and process control. Many types of data analysis techniques have been used on the data produced. This review covers aspects of analysis from data normalisation methods to pattern recognition and classification techniques. An overview of data visualisation such as non-linear mapping and multivariate statistical techniques is given. Focus is then on the use of artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy logic for classification and genetic algorithms for feature (sensor) selection. Application areas are covered with examples of the types of systems and analysis methods currently in use. Future trends in the analysis of sensor array data are discussed.",

A graph transaction is represented by an adjacency matrix, and the frequent patterns appearing in the matrices are mined through the extended algorithm of the basket analysis. Its performance has been evaluated for the artificial simulation data and the carcinogenesis data of Oxford University and NTP. Its high efficiency has been confirmed for the size of a real-world problem....",

abstract="This paper proposes a smart gas sensing system to achieve emotion recognition using breath gas information. A breath gas sensing system is designed by using a quartz crystal resonator with a plasma-polymer film as a sensor. For computational experiment of emotion recognition, the machine learning-based approaches, such as neural network (NN) and support vector machine(SVM), are investigated. In emotion recognition experiments by using gathered breath gas data under psychological experiments, the obtained maximum average emotion recognition rates are 75{\%} using ANN and 83{\%} using SVM for three emotions: pleasure, displeasure, and no emotion. Experimental results show that using breath gas information is feasible and the machine learning-based approach is well suited for this task.",

abstract="Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known technique to find an optimal alignment between two given (time-dependent) sequences under certain restrictions (Fig. 4.1). Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, DTW has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, DTW has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data.",
